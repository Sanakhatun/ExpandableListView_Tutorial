<b><h2>About ExpandableListView</h2></b>
  
  A view that shows items in a vertically scrolling two-level list. This differs from the ListView by allowing two levels: groups and respective children. Groups which can individually be expanded to show its children and collapsed to hide visible children. The items come from the ExpandableListAdapter associated with this view.
